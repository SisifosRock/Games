This is just a simple game that i made while learning about the p5.js library (which makes it really easy to do things like this in javascript).

Note: the game has some bugs like if you shoot and there's a enemy in the same y-axis as your ship but it is behind you then it will also affect the enemy, even though the shot didn't hit it. I know i could fix it, as well as add some things to make the game more difficult (right now there is no way to lose in this game) but i got homework to do, so if you want it just download the code and do it yourself.

Note2: if you play this game for 10 minutes straight you'll have this cool hallucination of thigs moving to the left of your field of vision :)
